Interview Questions and Code Katas
==================================
Originally I started this as a collection of implementation of interview
questions for various jobs. As I am mostly doing .Net and C# the
answers are implemented C#. In case there are multiple solutions
both are implemented. Have a look at the source.

To ensure correctness of the answers Unit tests are implemented.

## Interview Questions

The following questions are implemented:
* Reverse a sentence by reversing each word

## Code Katas

I started with Code Katas from http://codingkata.net/.  At the moment the following Katas are implemented:

* FizzBuzz (http://codingkata.net/Katas/Beginner/FizzBuzz)

## Some technical stuff...
For the implementation I used Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2013 and .Net 4.5.
